## To-Do List & Bullet List Formatting Preservation During Enhancement

### Issue
When enhancing a to-do list or bullet list in Delta format, only the first item maintained its original formatting. Subsequent items would lose their to-do/bullet formatting and become regular text. This happened because:

1. The text enhancement process extracts plain text from the Delta format
2. The enhanced text from OpenAI might have different line breaks or structure
3. When reconstructing the Delta object with the enhanced text, line break attributes (which contain to-do and bullet formatting) were not correctly mapped to the new lines

### Solution
Implemented a specialized handling method for to-do lists and bullet lists:

1. Detected formatted lists by checking for specific attributes (`list: 'unchecked'`, `list: 'checked'`, `list: 'bullet'`)
2. Created a dedicated `preserveListFormatting()` function to handle these special cases
3. This function:
   - Extracts all list formatting attributes from the original Delta
   - Applies those attributes to the corresponding line breaks in the enhanced text
   - Ensures each line maintains its to-do or bullet formatting, even if the number of lines changes

### Implementation Details
- Modified `enhanceText()` to detect formatted lists
- Added `preserveListFormatting()` function to handle preserving list attributes
- Preserved text formatting (like bold, italic) where possible
- Added tests to verify the fix works for both to-do and bullet lists

### Testing
The fix was tested with:
- To-do lists (using `list: 'unchecked'` attribute)
- Bullet lists (using `list: 'bullet'` attribute)
- Mixed formatting (both formatting on text and line breaks)

To run the test, use:
```bash
npm run test:todo-enhancement
```

### Results
After the fix, to-do lists and bullet lists maintain their formatting through the enhancement process, ensuring a better user experience when enhancing these types of content.
