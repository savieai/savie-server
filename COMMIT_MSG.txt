feat: Add calendar connection status to task extraction API

This commit adds a new `calendar_connected` boolean field to the `/api/ai/extract-tasks` endpoint response.
The field indicates whether the user has an active Google Calendar connection, allowing the frontend
to show appropriate UI elements when calendar tasks are detected.

Changes:
- Added Google Calendar connectivity check to the task extraction endpoint
- Added `calendar_connected` boolean to the API response
- Updated documentation with the new field information
- Added testing tools for verifying functionality

This change maintains backward compatibility as it only adds a new field without changing
existing response fields or behavior.
